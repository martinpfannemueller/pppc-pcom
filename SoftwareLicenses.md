# Introduction #

If there are legal issues with the contents of the repository or the web page, please contact me via <a href='mailto:marcus.handte@googlemail.com'>email</a> before contacting your lawyer. Without further ado, we will gladly remove whatever is necessary to make you happy.

We have tried to remove all code and as many resources as possible that were not created by someone from the team but chances are that we have missed something and if there is some artifact created by you, please let us know, so we can remove it from the repository or add the corresponding license to this page.

# The Intention #

Until recently, the PCOM code that you find in this repository was solely used internally. Since the code has become more mature over time, we would like to share the results with everyone for free without strings attached.

# Our License #

Consequently, we have decided to use a BSD license for everything developed by us. By using our code, you accept the following:
